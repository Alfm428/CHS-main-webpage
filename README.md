# CHS-main-webpage
This is made to enhance the web design of [www.chspatriots.com](https://www.chspatriots.com/).

### Guide for image use in the code
There are three logo options.

- [x] white.png (white colored main logo)
- [ ] original.png (original logo of the school)
- [ ] bright.png (photoshoped version of the original logo)

#### Additional info about the webpage

- The color that is used in the past and now is all at the top of the style file named style.css.

- Testimonial section is actually written by school students.

- GoogleMap button is linked to school address in the googlemap page.

- The pictures of the four exemplary teacher need to be updated. Also their email addresses are not real.

- On the last section the third option about bus routes need to be updated with provision of something about school.

- Navigation Bar doesn't really matter. So, it can be replaced for whatever fits. But there is a Toggleable nav bar when the screen is not big enough, so consider while changing the set up.

- Pictures included are private for now, but those are soon to be posted online that it is not my priority to protect their privacy.
